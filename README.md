# mbm-OW-Font
This is a font inspired by the Outer Wilds logo (by Mobius Digital, published by Annapurna Interactive) made by me modifying the Poppins font.
The original Poppins font (designed by Indian Type Foundry, Jonny Pinhorn, Ninad Kale) is avaiable here: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins


I made this intending to use it for an Outer Wilds sddm theme. We'll see if anything ever comes out of that.
